# Code-A-Thon-17
This is a set of solutions for the code-a-thon-2017 conducted by the ISTE chapter of Vellore Institute  of Technology. The combination of these solutions have been instrumental in me resulting in an overall rank of 35 after 2 rounds of eliminations( rank 16 in the first two rounds) and finally being in the top 35 list of honours of the competition of 27 hours.
